# DevExpress .NET MAUI Controls - Localize Controls
 
This repository demonstrates how to localize the [DevExpress .NET MAUI Scheduler Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/403734/scheduler-and-calendar/index?v=22.2). 

DevExpress .NET MAUI Controls contain localization strings that are translated into the following languages:

* [English (default language)](/CS/BasicLocalization/Resources/DevExpressMaui.resx)
* [Deutsch](/CS/BasicLocalization/Resources/DevExpressMaui.de.resx)
* [French](/CS/BasicLocalization/Resources/DevExpressMaui.fr.resx)

The repository contains the following projects:

| Project Name | Description |

| [LocalizeApplication](/CS/LocalizeApplication) | Demonstrates the use of localization resources to translate standard/DevExpress .NET MAUI Controls into Spanish. |
